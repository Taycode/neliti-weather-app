A Weather APP for Neliti Interview


You need to install all dependencies to be able to run the app smoothly using 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

you also need to create a .env file and fill in `OPENCAGE_API_KEY` which you can get from 
https://opencagedata.com/

You can run the app using 

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The weather app is on the page `/home` / `localhost:8000/home`

The UI isn't pretty because I didn't have time and I ain't much of a UX expert personally


Thanks and Regards.
